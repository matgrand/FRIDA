# FRIDA
routines/binaries of the FRIDA code.
The FRIDA (FRee-boundary Integro-Differential Axisimmetric) code expoits a coupled Finite Element Method – Boundary Element Method (FEM-BEM) approach for the solution of the free-boundary axi-symmetric plasma equilibrium problem (i.e., the Grad-Shafranov equation).
